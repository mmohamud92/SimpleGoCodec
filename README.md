# GoCodec

A simple, from-scratch video encoder project inspired by https://github.com/kevmo314/codec-from-scratch.

This repo is primarily for learning:
- Basic video encoding concepts
- Go (as an implementation language) through TDD (test-driven development)

## Status

Early/WIP. Expect rough edges and changing APIs.

## Development

Run all tests:

```sh
go test ./...
```
